Generate a concise commit message based on the following staged changes. Follow semantic commit conventions:

- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

The commit message should be in the format: type(scope): description

Where type is one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, build, ci, perf, revert
