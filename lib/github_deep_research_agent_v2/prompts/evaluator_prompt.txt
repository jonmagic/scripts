<INSTRUCTIONS>
Evaluate the current research progress and provide scores.

Assess:
1. Coverage: How well do the gathered facts address each aspect?
2. Confidence: How confident are we in answering the original question?
3. Source Diversity: How diverse are the sources (different repos, perspectives)?
4. Aspect Completion: What percentage of aspects have sufficient information?
5. Missing Aspects: Which aspects need more investigation?

Return ONLY a valid JSON object (no additional text):
{
  "coverage_score": 0.75,
  "confidence_score": 0.65,
  "source_diversity": 0.80,
  "aspect_completion": 0.70,
  "missing_aspects": ["Aspect ID 1", "Aspect ID 2"],
  "notes": [
    "Note about coverage gaps",
    "Note about information quality"
  ]
}

All scores should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
