<PLAN_OBJECTIVE>
Generate a comprehensive research plan to answer the user's question about GitHub conversations (issues, PRs, discussions).
Break down the question into distinct aspects/categories that need investigation.
For each aspect, provide specific search queries that will help gather relevant information.

<CONSTRAINTS>
- Maximum aspects: {{MAX_ASPECTS}}
- Each aspect must have at least 2 queries
- Queries should be specific and avoid duplicates
- Consider both semantic and keyword search approaches
- Include temporal filters where relevant (e.g., created:>YYYY-MM-DD)
</CONSTRAINTS>

<PLAN_OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure (no additional text):
{
  "question": "The research question",
  "aspects": [
    {
      "id": "A1",
      "title": "Brief aspect title",
      "strategy": "breadth-first or depth-first",
      "queries": ["Query 1", "Query 2", ...]
    }
  ],
  "depth_limit": 3,
  "breadth_limit": {{BREADTH_LIMIT}},
  "initial_hypotheses": ["Hypothesis 1", "Hypothesis 2"],
  "success_criteria": ["Criterion 1", "Criterion 2"]
}
</PLAN_OUTPUT_FORMAT>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
1. Analyze the question and identify 3-6 distinct aspects to investigate
2. For each aspect, generate 2-4 specific search queries
3. Ensure queries are diverse and non-overlapping
4. Set appropriate depth and breadth limits based on question complexity
5. Formulate initial hypotheses that could answer the question
6. Define success criteria for determining when sufficient information is gathered
7. Return ONLY the JSON object, no explanatory text
