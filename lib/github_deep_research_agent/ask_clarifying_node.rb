module GitHubDeepResearchAgent
  # AskClarifyingNode - Generates and collects clarifying questions to refine research focus
  #
  # See lib/github_deep_research_agent.rb for architecture and workflow details.
  #
  # ## Overview
  # After initial search, this node uses an LLM to generate up to 4 clarifying questions
  # that help specify research intent, scope, output format, and fill context gaps.
  # User answers are collected (via editor or file) and stored for downstream nodes.
  #
  # ## Pipeline Position
  # - Input: Initial research findings, user request
  # - Output: User clarifications for PlannerNode and others
  #
  # @example
  #   node = AskClarifyingNode.new
  #   questions = node.prep(shared)
  #   answers = node.exec(questions)
  #   node.post(shared, questions, answers)

You are an expert analyst reviewing a research request and initial findings from GitHub conversations.

## Research Request
{{request}}

## Initial Findings Summary
{{initial_findings}}

Based on the question and initial findings, generate up to 4 clarifying questions that would help you better understand the intent of the request, bridge gaps in context to better refine the search (e.g. specifying the search space like a github organization or repository), and understand the expected output format (executive summary, detailed analysis, ADR, etc). If any of these areas are covered in their request or initial findings, do not ask about them.

Format your response as a numbered list with clear, specific questions. Each question should be on its own line starting with a number. The instructions should ask for inline answers to these questions.
