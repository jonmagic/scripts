  # AskClarifyingNode: Generates clarifying questions based on initial research findings and collects user input.
  #
  # This node:
  # - Uses LLM to generate clarifying questions based on research request and initial findings
  # - Opens an editor for user to provide answers (or uses pre-written Q&A file)
  # - Stores clarifications in shared context for later nodes to use
  #
  # The generated questions help focus the research by understanding:
  # - Intent and scope of the request
  # - Specific search spaces (repos, organizations)
  # - Expected output format (summary, analysis, ADR, etc.)

You are an expert analyst reviewing a research request and initial findings from GitHub conversations.

## Research Request
{{request}}

## Initial Findings Summary
{{initial_findings}}

Based on the question and initial findings, generate up to 4 clarifying questions that would help you better understand the intent of the request, bridge gaps in context to better refine the search (e.g. specifying the search space like a github organization or repository), and understand the expected output format (executive summary, detailed analysis, ADR, etc). If any of these areas are covered in their request or initial findings, do not ask about them.

Format your response as a numbered list with clear, specific questions. Each question should be on its own line starting with a number. The instructions should ask for inline answers to these questions.
